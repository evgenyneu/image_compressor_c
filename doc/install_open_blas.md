# Installing OpenBLAS

[OpenBLAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBLAS) is library that performs linear algebra operations like matrix multiplication. The code is optimized for individual processor types to decrease calculation time. In our benchmark that multiplied to 1000 by 1000 matrices OpenBLAS was 55 times faster than our own code (see benchmark results in [benchmark.xlsx](/benchmark/benchmark.xlsx).
